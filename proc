# Inspired by [shoreman](https://github.com/hecticjeff/shoreman).

# Make sure that any errors cause the script to exit immediately.
set -e

# ## Usage

# Usage message that is displayed when `--help` is given as an argument.
usage() {
  echo "Usage: proc [<procfile>]"
  echo "Run procfile using shell."
  echo
  echo "The proc script reads commands from <procfile> and starts up the"
  echo "processes that it describes."
}

# If the --help option is given, show the usage message and exit.

# ## Logging

# For logging we want to prefix each entry with the current coordinated universal time,
# %N is not supported by date on Mac OS,
# as well as the process name. This takes one argument, the name of the process, and
# then reads data from stdin, formats it, and sends it to stdout.
log() {
  while read data
  do
    __TAB_CHARACTER=$'\t'
    echo "$(date -u +%FT%T.000Z) ${1}${__TAB_CHARACTER}| $data"
  done
}

# ## Running commands

# When a process is started, we want to keep track of its pid so we can
# `kill` it when the parent process receives a signal, and so we can `wait`
# for it to finish before exiting the parent process.
store_pid() {
  pids=("${pids[@]}" "$1")
}

# This starts a command asynchronously and stores its pid in a list for use
# later on in the script.
start_command() {
  sh -c "$1" &
  pid="$!"
  store_pid "$pid"
}

# ## Reading the .env file

# The .env file needs to be a list of assignments like in a shell script.
# Only lines containing an equal sign are read, which means you can add comments.
# Preferably shell-style comments so that your editor print them like shell scripts.

ENV_FILE=${2:-'.env'}
if [ -f $ENV_FILE ]; then
  while read line || [ -n "$line" ]; do
    if [[ "$line" == *=* ]]; then
      eval "export $line"
    fi
  done < "$ENV_FILE"
fi

# ## Reading the Procfile

# The Procfile needs to be parsed to extract the process names and commands.
# The file is given on stdin, see the `<` at the end of this while loop.
PROCFILE=${1:-'Procfile'}
while read line || [ -n "$line" ]; do
  name=${line%%:*}
  command=${line#*: }
  start_command "$command"
  echo "'${command}' started with pid ${pid}" | log "${name}.1"
  echo ${pid} > PIDFILE
done < "$PROCFILE"

# ## Cleanup

# When a `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM` or `EXIT` is received, this action is run, killing the
# child processes. The sleep stops STDOUT from pouring over the prompt, it
# should probably go at some point.
onexit() {
  echo SIGINT received
  echo sending SIGTERM to all processes
  kill ${pids[*]} &>/dev/null
  sleep 1
}
trap onexit SIGINT SIGTERM EXIT

# Wait for the children to finish executing before exiting.
